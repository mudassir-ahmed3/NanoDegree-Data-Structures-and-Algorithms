I didn't introduce any new data structures. I add one user in each class and then try to access them from
parent using a recursive for loop. First it will look into the users of the called group and then one by
one go through the users of each of its groups.

The time complexity will be O(n) as it will go through each list of users.

The Space complexity will be O(n) as stack space will be required for recursive calls.
