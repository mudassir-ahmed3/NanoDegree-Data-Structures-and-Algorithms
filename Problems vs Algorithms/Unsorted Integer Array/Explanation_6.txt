take the first element of input list as minimum and maximum integer initially
then traverse through the list:
	 In traversal, if find any number smaller than our min update min
	 	      if find any number bigger than our max update max


return min,max

as we're going through the list in a single traversal, the time complexity will be O(n)
as we don't have any data structure that's growing with input size, space complexity will be O(1)
